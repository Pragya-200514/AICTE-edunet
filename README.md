## üîå EV Charging Demand Predictionüîãüîã

**Forecast EV charging demand** using machine learning to optimize station use and support sustainable mobility.

###Project Goals
- Develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts EV charging behavior.
- Identify the factors that influence EV charging behavior.

###Getting Started
1. *Data Collection*: Gather a dataset of EV charging patterns, including variables such as:
    - Time of day
    - Day of the week
    - Location (latitude and longitude)
    - Charging duration
    - Energy consumed
2. *Data Preprocessing*: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.
3. *Feature Engineering*: Extract relevant features from the data that can be used to train the model.
4. *Model Training*: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
5. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) or mean squared error (MSE).

###Model Development
2. *Train the Model*: Train the model using the preprocessed data.
3. *Hyperparameter Tuning*: Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.

###Deployment
1. *Deploy the Model*: Deploy the trained model in a production-ready environment.
2. *Integrate with Charging Infrastructure*: Integrate the model with charging infrastructure to provide real-time predictions.

###Tools and Technologies
- *Python*: Programming language used for data analysis and model development.
- *Pandas*: Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- *Scikit-learn*: Library used for machine learning model development.
- *TensorFlow*: Library used for deep learning model development.

### Approach
1. **Data**: Historical charging logs + external factors (weather, holidays, time of day).  
2. **Models**: ARIMA/Prophet, Random Forest/XGBoost, LSTM.  
3. **Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, R¬≤.  
4. **Visualization**: Demand heatmaps & time‚Äëseries plots.

### Impact
- Improves station planning and load balancing  
- Reduces wait times and energy waste  
- Enables smarter, greener cities
